## Technical Concepts Explained

### 1. Frontend (What Users See)
```
Next.js
- What: Framework for building web applications
- Think of it like: Building blocks for websites
- Benefits: Makes complex features easier to implement

React
- What: Library for building user interfaces
- Think of it like: Lego pieces for websites
- Benefits: Reusable components, easy updates

TailwindCSS
- What: Styling framework
- Think of it like: Pre-made design tools
- Benefits: Faster styling, consistent design
```

### 2. Backend (Server Side)
```
API (Application Programming Interface)
- What: Way for different services to communicate
- Think of it like: A waiter in a restaurant
- Example: When our tool needs to get data from Google Analytics

Database
- What: Where we store all information
- Think of it like: A digital filing cabinet
- Types we'll use: 
  • PostgreSQL: For user data and relationships
  • MongoDB: For storing audit results and reports
```

## Notes for Civil Engineer
- Think of this project like building a structure:
  - Foundation = Database and basic setup
  - Framework = Next.js and React
  - Utilities = APIs and integrations
  - Finishing = UI and user experience

- We'll follow a similar approach to construction:
  1. Planning (Requirements and design)
  2. Foundation (Core setup)
  3. Structure (Main features)
  4. Finishing (UI/UX and optimizations)
  5. Testing (Quality assurance)
  6. Maintenance (Updates and improvements)

Would you like me to explain any of these sections in more detail or create additional documentation for specific parts?
